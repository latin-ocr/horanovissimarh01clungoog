EXTRACT FROM EDITORS‘ PREFACE.

Tmz inconvenience and costliness of the number of separate Books usually requisite for the members
of a cheir, in the performance of an ordinary Choral Service, have long pointed to the desirableness of a
manual which should, as far as possible, unite under one cover all that is necessary for the choral rendering
of, at least, those portions of the Church’s Services which are less liable to variation.

The Music of the Versicles and Res onses-Festal as well as F erial—a. Psalter and Canticles

. pointed for chanting‚ are almost indis ensab e for the careful and accurate rendering of a Choral Service.
And yet, hithert0‚ it has been sear y possible to procure these, unless in separate numbers; involving
not only much additional expense, but also the disadvantage arising from the continual shisting of books
during Ser-vice time, which is such a hindrance to a devout participation in Divine Worship.

To remedy these evils, and to assist in romoting‚ as it is hoped‚ a more careful and reverend
persor-mance of the Divine Offices, the cathedra? Prayer Book has been compiled.

The Editors are fully aware that they are not the first to make an effort in this direction. But the
believe that several circumstances have tended to favour their attempt, and ensure its succesS, whic
have been wantin in other instances.

This man provides not only for the daily Morning and Evening Prayer, and the choral celebration
of the Holy communion, in all its completeness, but also for the whole of the occasional Offices contained
in the Book of Common Ptayer. A s ecial feature of it, moreover, is that it includes an Appendix, in
which are contained not only Tallis’s estival Responses and Litany, but a eat deal of other additional
and miscellaneous matter which it is conjectured will add greatly to its usef ness and value.

The Versicles and Responses throughout the Book (exclusive of the Ap endix) and the Litany are
from the arrangement ‚used in St. Paul’s Cathedral (Stainer and Martin, founded on Goss). They follow
Merbecke‚ although with one or two slight variatione which have become traditione-l in the Cathedral of
the Metropoli& and. more recently, in man other Churches.

The Music to the Order for the A ministration of the Holy communion follows the Edition of
Merbecke given in “A Choir Book of the Office of Holy Communion” Stainer), and published some years
since. The Order for the Burial of the Dead has also been arranged om Merbecke by the same Editor.

’ The pointing of the Psalms and Canticles is after that known as the Cathedral Psalter, edited by the
Rev. S. Flood-Jones, the late Mr. James Turle, Dr. Troutbeck‚ Sir ohn Stainer‚ and Mr. Joseph Barnby.
